        This webpage was inspired by the Facebook group called "W&M Places I've Cried Group."
        Our mission has two components. Firstly, we wanted to create platform that allowed for 
        having a centralized database for W&M crying affairs. Secondly, we hope to highlight
        the increased stress that the pandemic has caused for students, staff, and faculty alike
        and validate the collective struggle of the current situtation.
